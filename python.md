## Python Coding Practises

In principle we will follow the PEP8 guidelines 

[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

We will also try to follow R coding practises where relevant (unless the ycontradict with PEP8).

- Functions should be all lower case with underscores separating words
```python 
def my_function():
    ...
````

- Variable names should be broken with underscores and prefixed with a data type signifier
```python 
 a_long_name
```

- Constants should be in all caps
```python
A_CONSTANT
```

- No spaces between parameters in a function
```python
my_function(a = "foo", b = "bar")
```
