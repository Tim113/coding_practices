## Python Coding Practises

We will try to follow R coding practises where relevant.

- Functions should be all lower case with underscores separating words
```python 
def my_function():
    ...
````

- Variable names should be broken with underscores and prefixed with a data type signifier
```python 
 a_long_name
```

- Constants should be in all caps
```python
A_CONSTANT
```
