# ELI5 Documention for Setting up and Securing a Resilient Stack

The aim of this documentation to be a quick reference to setting these elements of a good stack up quickly.

Each document should be easily readable and digestable in around 5 - 10 minutes.  Documents should only take 1 - 3 hours to write.

Each module should start with a _TL;DR_ of why this process should be done, such that the user has a reason to continue reading.
